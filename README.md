I'll review your README.md file and suggest improvements to address any issues. Here's my analysis and recommended fixes:

## Issues and Solutions:

1. **Formatting Issues**:

   - The appointment workflow section has inconsistent markdown formatting
   - Some code blocks don't have proper language tags
   - Some headers could be better organized

2. **Content Issues**:

   - Missing proper setup instructions for TypeScript
   - No information about testing
   - Missing license information
   - Some placeholder links need to be updated

3. **Structural Issues**:
   - The project structure could be described more clearly
   - Missing contribution guidelines
   - No information about error handling

## Improved README.md:
